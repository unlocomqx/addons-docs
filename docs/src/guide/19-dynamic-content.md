# Dynamic content

Using the `HTML` or the `Feature` fields, you can display dynamic content easily.  
To do that, you can include your fields inside the configured content by surrounding the field name with brackets.  

Example:

````html
The calculation is [width] * [height] = [total]
````

- **HTML config**

<img srcset="/images/html-config.jpg 2x" class="border">

- **Feature config**

<img srcset="/images/feature-config.jpg 2x" class="border">

The fields will be dislayed like this

<img srcset="/images/dynamic-content.jpg 2x" class="padding border">
