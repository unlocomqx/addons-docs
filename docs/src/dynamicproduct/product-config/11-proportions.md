# Proportions

The proportions feature is useful if you want to keep two fields in sync.  
Let's say you want the **length** field to be always double the **width**,
you can do that like this:

<img srcset="/dynamicproduct/images/proportion.jpg 2x">

That way, the two field will be always in sync

<img srcset="/dynamicproduct/images/proportion-values.jpg 2x" class="padding border">

So when you update the **length**, the **width** value gets updated and vice-versa.
