# Combination values

You can easily vary the value of a field based on the product combinations.

Select the field that you want to vary from the list in the top right corner, then enter a value for
each desired combination

The field will take the initial value if the current combination does not have a value associated.

In this example, we change the `unit_price` based on the selected combination to make the price more
expensive for sizes `M` and `L`.

We also change the minimum required order quantity based on the combination.
