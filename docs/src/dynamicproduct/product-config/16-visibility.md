# Visibility

You can show or hide fields based on the selected combination.

<img srcset="/dynamicproduct/images/visibility-values.jpg 2x" class="border padding">

You can also hide all the fields by unchecking the corresponding checkbox under the `All` column.

If you hide the module, make sure to uncheck
the [required option](/dynamicproduct/product-config/06-settings.md#required-customization).

::: tip  
When a field is hidden, its value will be 0 or empty so it doesn't have an effect on the price
