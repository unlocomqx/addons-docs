# Custom style

You can add custom style file which will be included when the module is enabled for a product.

For that, you need to create a `CSS` file called `dynamic.css`.

You can place the css file in one of these folder:

- `/css`
- `/themes/[current theme]/assets/css`

You can also name the file `dynamicX.css` where `X` is the product ID. This file will only be loaded
for the product with ID=**X**
