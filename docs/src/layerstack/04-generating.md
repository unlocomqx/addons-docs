# Generating images

When generating the images, the app will display the progress as well as the current image.

That way, you can see the preview directly and check if it's correct.

You can cancel at any time and start over.

<img srcset="/layerstack/images/generating-images.jpg 2x" class="border">

The app will assign the images to the product variants automatically.
