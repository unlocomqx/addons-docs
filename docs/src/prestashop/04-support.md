# Addons Support

To ensure the fastest and best support, please follow this guide

### Use English or French as much as possible

Send me your message in English or French. Also, set the backoffice language to either of these languages.
In the case of the [Dynamic Product module](/dynamicproduct/), name your fields in one the mentioned languages. It will
make it easier for me to understand the calculation logic and to better assist you.

### Include a product link in your message

Sometimes, the issue is caused by a conflict between the module and the theme that is installed on your shop.  
That's why a product link is needed to check the issue directly.

::: tip  
Generally, when an issue is fixed for a product, it will also be fixed for other products.

### Include a backoffice and ftp access if necessary

Access to the configuration is sometimes needed to make quick changes and fix an issue.

In the case of a server error, access to the ftp is crucial to make the necessary fixes.

### List the steps to follow in order to reproduce the issue

To be able to find a solution, we need to first be able to replicate the issue and determine the cause of the problem.

Make sure to include any information that you think is relevant to the issue.

::: tip  
Include the front-office login if the issue occurs when you are logged in.
