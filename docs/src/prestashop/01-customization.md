# Customization

Our customization modules use the standard PrestaShop customization system under the hood.

This is a great aspect, as it ensures compatibility with other modules and themes.

To see if a module or theme supports the PrestaShop customization system, you can create a test
product containing a customization text field.

<img srcset="/prestashop/images/options-tab.jpg 2x" class="border padding">

Then you can add a customization field like this

<img srcset="/prestashop/images/customization-field.jpg 2x" class="border padding">

The field will be displayed like this

<img srcset="/prestashop/images/customization-field-display.jpg 2x" class="border padding">

You can then save a customization and add it to cart to make the necessary tests.
