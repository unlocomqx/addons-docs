# Dynamic Product module

The Product Designer module and the Dynamic Product module are compatible and can be enabled for the
same product.

The two modules will both affect the product cost and will both display the customization summary in
the cart page and in the order page as well as some other features.

## Syncing product width and height

If you want the product width and height to be synced between the two modules, you need to follow
these steps:

- Enable the [dynamic size](/productdesigner/product-config/09-product-size.md)
  in `Product Designer`
- Add two [fields](/dynamicproduct/product-config/07-fields.md) named `width` and `height`
  in `Dynamic Product`
- Make sure that the initial values as well as the min/max settings match between the two modules

## Displaying Dynamic Product inside the Designer interface

You can display the dynamic module inside the designer module by
enabling [this option](/productdesigner/03-configuration.md#show-dynamic-product-in-the-product-tab)
