# Image colors

In this section, you can choose whether to enable image colorization and which colors to enable

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/product-image-colors.jpg 2x" class="border">

::: tip  
For an effective colorization, you need to provide white images or light colored images
:::

::: tip White image groups  
You can flag an image group as [containing white images](/productdesigner/03-configuration/image-groups.md#white-image-group)

When an image is added from this group, it will be automatically colorized using the first available color.
:::

Here's an example showcasing this feature

Original image

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/cloud.png 2x" class="border transparent">

Colorized image

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/image-colorized.jpg 2x">

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/image-colorized-2.jpg 2x">

::: tip  
When colorizing an image, the module will skip transparent pixels.  
So you can turn the areas that you don't want to be colorized into transparent areas.
