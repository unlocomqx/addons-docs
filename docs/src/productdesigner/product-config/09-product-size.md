# Product size

You can enable this feature to allow the customer to change the product size dynamically.

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/product-size.jpg 2x" class="padding">

The product size will be displayed like this

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/product-size-display.jpg 2x">

You can set the cost per mÂ² as well as the cost for each area interval.

You can also set the initial size, the minimum and the maximum sizes.

The module will validate the product size before allowing the design to be added to cart.

Examples:

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/width-error.jpg 2x" class="padding border">

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/height-error.jpg 2x" class="padding border">
