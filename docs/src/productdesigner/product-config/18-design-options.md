# Design options

In this tab, we have many options that are related to the design in general.

## Show design item dimension

This option will override the global option
for [displaying the item dimension](/productdesigner/03-configuration/design-options.md#show-design-items-dimensions)

## Save current side only

This will allow you to use product sides as if they were product variants.  
The customers can then pick a product variant, add their design and add to cart.  
Only the selected side will be added.

## Use a single color for texts & images

If enabled, the module will synchronise the colors between texts and images and will only allow the
use of one color.  
When the customer changes the color of one item, that same color will be applied to all other items.

## Enable resizing/moving item

You can disable these options if you want the design items to be fixed.

## Minimum item size

Set the minimum item size in centimeters. This is important if you have strict production criteria.
