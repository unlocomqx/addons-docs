## Use image cost directly

This will allow using the [image price](/productdesigner/03-configuration.md#price-per-m2) without
multiplying it by the area of the image.

If the image is a customer upload, then the [upload cost](#upload-cost) will be used.

## Image cost

This will be added to the total for every image that is added to the design. This cost will not
replace the [image prices](/productdesigner/03-configuration.md#price-per-m2)

## Image cost per m²

Configure this price if you want to replace
the [image prices](/productdesigner/03-configuration.md#price-per-m2)

## Image cost intervals

Allows setting different costs for different size ranges

the [Use image cost directly](/productdesigner/product-config/22-image-pricing.md#use-image-cost-directly)
