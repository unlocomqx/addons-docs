<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/product-colors-display.jpg 2x">

The customer can colorize the product dynamically, you don't need to generate the images manually.

::: tip  
For an effective colorization, you need to provide the white version of the product

- Example image

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/t-shirt.png 2x" class="border">

- Colorized images

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/t-shirt-blue.png 2x" class="border">

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/t-shirt-orange.png 2x" class="border">

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/t-shirt-green.png 2x" class="border">

::: tip  
When colorizing an image, the module will skip transparent pixels.  
So you can turn the areas that you don't want to be colorized into transparent areas.
