# Real size

In order for the module to calculate the design cost, it need to know the product real size
in `centimeters`.

You can determine this real size by resizing the ruler and entering the size in `cm`.

You can also define a real size for each combination image if your product has different images

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/real-size-images.jpg 2x">

You can also define a different size for each side of the product.

::: tip  
If no real size is defined for an image, the real size of the default image will be used.
