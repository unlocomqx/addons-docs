# Colors

You can configure available colors in this section

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/colors.jpg 2x">

These colors will be used for text colors, image colors and product colors.

Here are the color properties

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/color-edit.jpg 2x">

You can also add a texture instead of a plain color. Make sure that your texture file is seamless so
that it could be tiled properly by the module.

The colors/textures will be displayed like this in the interface

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/colors-list.jpg 2x">

The module also allows you to choose which colors to enable for each product and also for each
feature (text colors, image colors, etc...). This can be done in
the [Product configuration](/productdesigner/product-config/).

::: tip Supported file types
The supported file types for textures are: `svg` `png` `jpg` `jpeg`
