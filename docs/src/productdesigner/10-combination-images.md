# Combination images

If you want the image that is displayed in the designer to change according to the selected product
combination, then you need to follow these steps

:one: Assign a different image for each product combination

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/combinations.jpg 2x" class="border padding">

Then when each combination is selected, the corresponding image is displayed in the designer

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/combination-image.jpg 2x">

:two: (Optionally) Assign a [base image](/productdesigner/product-config/07-images.md#base-image) to
each combination image

For example, in this case, we want to display the original images without the margins that
PrestaShop introduces when resizing the images

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/base-images.jpg 2x">

Thus, we have this display

<img srcset="/productdesigner/images/combination-alternative-image.jpg 2x">
