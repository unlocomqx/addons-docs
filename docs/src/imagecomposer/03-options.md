## Automatic colorization

:one: To colorize option images automatically, start by uploading the variant base image.

<img srcset="/imagecomposer/images/base-image.jpg 2x">

::: tip  
The base image should preferably have a light color, so that the colors are applied effectively.

:two: Then pick a color for each option.

:three: Then click the colorize button

If no color is selected, then the variant base image will be copied as it is.
