In the options panel, you can assign an image to each variant option.

## Automatic colorization

:one: To colorize option images automatically, start by uploading the variant base image.

<img srcset="/imagecomposer/images/base-image.jpg 2x">

::: tip  
The base image should preferably have a light color, so that the colors are applied effectively.
:::

:two: Then pick a color for each option.

<img srcset="/imagecomposer/images/color-picker.jpg 2x" class="border padding">

:three: Then click the colorize button

<img srcset="/imagecomposer/images/colorize-btn.jpg 2x">

If no color is selected, then the variant base image will be copied as it is.

::: tip  
To colorize a single option, upload the base image to the desired option then click the colorize
button like so:

<img srcset="/imagecomposer/images/colorize-option.jpg 2x" class="border">

## Combining variants

If your images depend on the combination of two variants, you can group these variants to be able to
configure an image for each combination.

<img srcset="/imagecomposer/images/group-btn.jpg 2x">

Then select the subgroup(s).

<img srcset="/imagecomposer/images/subgroups-modal.jpg 2x">

The two variants in this case will be combined, thus allowing you more control over the option
images.

## Grouping similar options

If you have options that are visually similar, you can group them like this.

First, select a base option.

<img srcset="/imagecomposer/images/similar-options.jpg 2x">

Then select the similar options.

<img srcset="/imagecomposer/images/similar-options-modal.jpg 2x">

The similar options will use the same image as the base option, thus producing fewer variant images.

## Reordering variants

You can reorder the variants to configure the layers order by clicking on this icon.
